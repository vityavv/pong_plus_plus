## About
### What is Pong++?
This game is based off of Pong, the game that is installed on the game console, Pong, that is credited to be the first home video game console ever.
### Why did you make Pong++?
I decided to make Pong++ not because I thought I could make a better pong than multiple generations of programers. I decided to make it to flex my creative and programming knowledge muscles. Also, this is the first time I'm using Git/GitHub so I'm practicing that as well.
### What about you?
I am a 13-year-old (at the time of writing) who likes web dev (frontend (so far...)) and skiing. And (performance of) music. More about me, like my contact information, and all of my other projects, can be found [here](http://users.lk.net/~vityav/)
